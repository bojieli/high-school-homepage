Dear Abby, 
How are you? Today I’ve got a wonderful news to tell you. 76._______ 
I have offered a scholarship at a university in Australia for my 77._______ 
further education. One hundred and twenty students took exam 78._______ 
for it, but only a few was chosen and I was one of them. However, 79._______ 
my parents are not happy about it. They are strong against me 80._______ 
going there. They say it is too far away that they will not see me 81._______ 
for a whole year and they are afraid of I will feel lonely. They 82._______ 
can’t imagine a girl so young live alone. They advise me to study 83._______ 
in the capital instead. Then I’ll be able to continue living with 84._______ 
them. How can I persuade them to accept the fact I have grown up? 85._______ 
Best wishes, 
Jane
